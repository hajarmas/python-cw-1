# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
print (4+4)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
name = "hajar" 
age = 17
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
print(f"my name is {name} I'm {age} years old")
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length = 10
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 15
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area = (length*width)

# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f"linth*width")
# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.
